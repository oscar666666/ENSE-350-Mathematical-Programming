how this program work?

This program is written using python3.

p $ q are two prime numbers declared in main
n = p * q
phi(n) = (p - 1)*(q - 1)
I'm using a while loop to generate e
so gcd(e, phi(n)) == 1
I'm using this algorithm to calculate d
int(((2*self.phi)+1)/self.e)

For encoding I just simply calculate c = rem(m^e, n)
for decoding I just simply calculate rem(c^d, n)
